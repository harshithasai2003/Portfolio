        <div>
            <p1>Being a fourth-year CSE undergrad, Data Science enthusiast with a CGPA of 9.26, I chose computer science as my major as I was always intrigued with programming. I've always had a strong interest in maths, and I received 10s on all of my exams. After some time, I found my love for data science as it involved both programming and math. With my strong mathematical skills and programming skills, I have decided to become a data scientist. </p1>
            <p1>I have conducted data analysis on two real-world data sets.  I used the Python and R programming languages to analyse these two data sets. I enjoy working with data to uncover hidden insights and visualise them. I am determined to finish the work on time. I also have experience in web development as I have created few websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am the Vice President of GITAM Women Leader’s Forum (WLF) and  also a member of the Operating Committee of the Centre For Autonomous Systems (CAS) GITAM.</p1>
