        <div>
            <p1>I am a computer science undergraduate with an interest in the domain of data science and machine learning. My interest in mathematics and science goes back to my early years. I have used Python and R programming languages to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world data sets.</p1>
            <p1>I worked on my final-year project, "Harmony Forecast: Using Machine Learning to Predict Relationship Quality" aiming to forecast the compatibility of a relationship. In addition, I have contributed to other research papers on for brain tumor prediction. I am also very interested in web development and made a few websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy working with data to uncover hidden insights and visualize them. I have been Vice President of GITAM WLF(Women Leader's Forum) for a year and also a member of the Operating Committee of the Centre for Autonomous Systems (CAS) GITAM.  As a continuous learner, I aim to become knowledgeable about and familiar with as many tools and technologies as possible to stay up-to-date in the swiftly advancing world.</p1>
