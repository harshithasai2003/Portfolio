            <p style="text-align:justify;"><p1> Technology has always fascinated and inspired me.
             It is a privilege to be born in the 21st Century and witness the human race push the boundaries of creativity and innovation, creating what once was impossible. 
             Every day, the world in which we live undergoes enormous transformations. New technologies are regularly emerging in every field. 
             Most notably, several tools and technologies have been emerging rapidly in Computer Science. I have, with great interest, observed this evolution of Computer Technology.
             As a continuous learner, I, Harshitha Sai Nallagonda, aim to become knowledgeable about and familiar with as many tools and technologies as possible to stay up-to-date in the swiftly advancing world.
